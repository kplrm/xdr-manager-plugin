# XDR Coordinator

OpenSearch Dashboards plugin for enrolling, managing, upgrading, and monitoring xdr-agent endpoints.

## Requirements

- OpenSearch is already running.
- OpenSearch Dashboards is already running and connected to that OpenSearch cluster.
- OpenSearch Dashboards version: `3.5.0`.

## Current features

- Agent inventory with `healthy`, `offline`, and `unseen` states.
- Policy management from the UI: create, edit, and delete policies.
- Enrollment token generation and token consumption tracking.
- Agent-facing APIs for enroll, heartbeat, command polling, and telemetry ingestion.
- Agent removal and queued upgrade command delivery.
- Latest xdr-agent version lookup from GitHub Releases.
- Telemetry dashboards for host, process, and network data from `.xdr-agent-telemetry-*` indices.
- Saved object persistence for agents and enrollment tokens.

## Deploy

### Option 1 — Replace the OpenSearch Dashboards container (recommended)

Pre-built images with the plugin already baked in are published to the GitHub Container Registry for every release. This is the only approach that survives container recreation.

Update the `opensearch-dashboards` service image in your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  opensearch-dashboards:
    image: ghcr.io/kplrm/opensearch-dashboards-xdr:latest
    container_name: opensearch-dashboards
    ports:
      - 5601:5601
    environment:
      - OPENSEARCH_HOSTS=["http://opensearch-node1:9200"]
      - DISABLE_SECURITY_DASHBOARDS_PLUGIN=true
    networks:
      - opensearch-net
    depends_on:
      - opensearch-node1
```

Recreate the container:

```bash
docker compose up -d opensearch-dashboards
```

Available image tags:
- `ghcr.io/kplrm/opensearch-dashboards-xdr:latest` — most recent release
- `ghcr.io/kplrm/opensearch-dashboards-xdr:v0.1.0` — pinned version

> **Note:** the image can also be pulled and run with plain `docker run` on any machine with Docker, no compose required:
> ```bash
> docker pull ghcr.io/kplrm/opensearch-dashboards-xdr:latest
> ```

### Option 2 — Install into the running container

> **Warning:** changes made via `docker exec` are stored in the container's writable layer and are **lost whenever the container is recreated** (e.g. `docker compose up -d`, Docker daemon restart with a restart policy, or explicit `docker compose rm`). Use this option only for quick testing on a single machine. For persistent deployments use Option 1.

```bash
VERSION=0.1.0
OSD_VERSION=3.5.0

docker exec opensearch-dashboards \
  /usr/share/opensearch-dashboards/bin/opensearch-dashboards-plugin install --allow-root \
  "https://github.com/kplrm/xdr-coordinator/releases/download/v${VERSION}/xdr-coordinator_${VERSION}_osd-${OSD_VERSION}.zip"
```

Verify the plugin directory was created before restarting:

```bash
docker exec opensearch-dashboards ls /usr/share/opensearch-dashboards/plugins/
# xdrCoordinator should appear in the list
```

Then restart:

```bash
docker restart opensearch-dashboards
```

### Option 3 — Install on a bare-metal OpenSearch Dashboards

```bash
VERSION=0.1.0
OSD_VERSION=3.5.0
sudo /usr/share/opensearch-dashboards/bin/opensearch-dashboards-plugin install \
  "https://github.com/kplrm/xdr-coordinator/releases/download/v${VERSION}/xdr-coordinator_${VERSION}_osd-${OSD_VERSION}.zip"
sudo systemctl restart opensearch-dashboards
```

After any of the above, open OpenSearch Dashboards and verify that **XDR Coordinator** appears in the left navigation.

## Build from source

From the OpenSearch Dashboards root:

```bash
yarn osd bootstrap --single-version=loose
cd plugins/xdr-coordinator
cat VERSION
yarn build
```

The ZIP artifact is created in `plugins/xdr-coordinator/build/`.

The plugin version is defined in `VERSION`. The build syncs `package.json` and `opensearch_dashboards.json` from that file.

## xdr-agent enrollment

1. Open **XDR Coordinator**.
2. Create or select a policy.
3. Generate an enrollment token.
4. Set these values in `xdr-agent/config/config.json`:

```json
{
	"control_plane_url": "http://<opensearch-dashboards-host>:5601",
	"enrollment_path": "/api/v1/agents/enroll",
	"enrollment_token": "xdr_enroll_<generated-token>",
	"policy_id": "<policy-id>"
}
```

The agent will then enroll, send heartbeats, poll for commands, and ship telemetry to the control plane.
